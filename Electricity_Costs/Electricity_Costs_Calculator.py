#Okay, so the irrigation system works with a diesel powedered pump, which takes water from the reservoir and delivers it to the plantation.
#This engine outputs 60cv, or about 45kW, while consuming 12 to 13 liters of diesel fuel each hour.
#The pump operates about 25 hours each week, split between 2-3 days.

#Variables I'll be using
#diesel consumption and price
#electricity consumption and price
#switching price (that includes new posts, cables, transformers and a new engine)
#solar energy setup price
